Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
* Pretty regular commits, but maybe not the most descriptive to the outside user.

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?
* Indentation, spacing, naming all seem really well-done.

Were branching and looping used effectively?
* Looping and branching were almost perfect, but in the branching example perhaps something could be returned when the user entered anything other than a number.

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?
* Yes.

Is the site user-friendly?
* Yes.

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?
* Keep up the great work.
